# Security labs

In the Security labs, I gained hands-on experience with a range of essential security tools and practices. I learned how to perform networking hardening and system hardening to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security posture. The labs also introduced key data protection techniques and provided practical exposure to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for controlling access to cloud resources. In addition, I worked with firewall configurations, explored malware protection methods, and learned how to monitor EC2 instances effectively to detect and respond to potential security threats.
