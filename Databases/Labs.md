# Databases lab 

- In this databases lab, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of essential database operations and tools. I learned how to perform database table operations, including inserting, updating and deleting data. I practiced selecting data from a database and performing conditional searches to retrieve specific information. The lab also introduced me to working with database functions and organizing data effectively. Additionally, I explored building a database server and interacting with it using an application. I gained foundational knowledge of cloud-based database services, including Amazon Aurora and Amazon DynamoDB and completed a challenge that involved building and accessing an RDS server. Overall, this lab provided practical experience in managing, organizing, and accessing databases in both local and cloud environments
