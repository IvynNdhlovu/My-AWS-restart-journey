# Networking Labs

- In this labs, I gained hands-on experience with key networking concepts, including the use of Public and Private IP addresses, as well as Static and Dynamic IP addressing. I also learned how to create a subnet within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and worked with various networking resources used in VPC configuration. Additionally, the lab covered Internet Protocol troubleshooting commands, which helped me understand how to identify and resolve common network issues effectively.
